The News Widget in the Planner App utilizes the News Catcher API to retrieve the latest news headlines from a variety of sources.
This API allows the widget to fetch real-time news data, ensuring that users stay informed with the most recent developments.

The code for the News Widget is implemented using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It leverages the Axios library to make HTTP requests to the News Catcher API. By specifying the API endpoint and providing the necessary API key, the widget retrieves a collection of news articles.

Upon fetching the data, the widget extracts the headlines from the articles and stores them in the component's state using the useState hook provided by React. This state allows the widget to manage and update the headlines dynamically.

The News Widget limits the number of headlines displayed to 5, providing a concise overview of the latest news.

It offers a comprehensive selection of news content across various categories and topics.
